<h2>biography</h2>

<p>I am Tam luong. I was born in Vietnam. I went to high school in Singapore then attended Tufts University in Boston, Massachussetts. My majors are Quantitative Economics and Computer Science. I am deeply interested in both disciplines and hope that in the future I can have a job which utilizes skills from both fields. In the past, I have interned at Interdist, a pharmaceutical firm in Vietnam, as an assistant market researcher. I also interned for three months at State Street Hangzhou when I was in China.</p>
